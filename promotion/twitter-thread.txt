ðŸ§µ THREAD: Why I built WindFlow CSS as a Tailwind alternative (1/7)

The problem: Tailwind is great, but lacks advanced animations and modern CSS features that today's web demands. (2/7)

WindFlow solution: 58+ animations, 9 themes, advanced grid layouts, all with zero build process required. (3/7)

New in v2.2.0: Morph animations, neon theme, enhanced grids, better text decorations. (4/7)

Performance: 374KB of utilities vs writing custom CSS. 92/100 performance score. (5/7)

Migration: 100% Tailwind compatible. Use our automated migration tool. (6/7)

Try it: npm install windflow-css

**Maker Comment**:
"Hey Product Hunt! ðŸ‘‹

I built WindFlow because I was tired of choosing between Tailwind's simplicity and having advanced animations. Why not have both?

After months of development, v2.2.0 includes 58+ animations, 9 themes, and modern CSS features that work out of the box.

Perfect for developers who want Tailwind's productivity with the visual polish that modern web demands.

Try it: npm install windflow-css

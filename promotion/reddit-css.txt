**WindFlow CSS: Advanced Animations Meet Utility-First Design**

r/css, check out this utility framework with some serious animation power:

## ðŸŽ¬ Animation Highlights
- **58+ pre-built animations**: From basic fades to complex morphing
- **Modern effects**: Glitch, matrix, neon, glassmorphism
- **3D transforms**: Full perspective and rotation support
- **Custom easing**: Elastic, bounce, back, expo curves

## ðŸŽ¨ CSS Features
- **Advanced gradients**: Linear, radial, conic, mesh, animated
- **Backdrop filters**: Full glassmorphism support
- **Modern CSS**: Container queries, scroll snap, aspect ratio
- **Typography**: Enhanced text decorations, font variants

## ðŸ’¡ Philosophy
Utility-first like Tailwind, but with the animations and modern CSS features that designers actually want.

Example:
```css
.animate-morph {
  animation: morph 8s ease-in-out infinite;
  border-radius: 40% 60% 60% 40% / 60% 30% 70% 40%;
}
```
